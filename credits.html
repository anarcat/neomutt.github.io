<h1>Credits</h1>
<h2 class="subtitle">Who do we thank?</h2>

<p>
  Many people have written or worked on patches for Mutt.
  But despite their hard work, few users have benefited.
  NeoMutt is a project of projects.
  Which builds on all the work that came before.
</p>

<h2>FlatCap</h2>

<p>
  So far, NeoMutt is a project of one person: <b>Richard Russon</b>
  <a href="https://github.com/flatcap">(FlatCap)</a>.
  He took all the old patches and painstakingly sorted through them, fixed them
  up and documented them.
</p>

<h2>Friends of NeoMutt</h2>

<p>
  The NeoMutt project is starting to gather developers.
  These people have directly helped NeoMutt.  Thank you.
</p>

<p>
  GitHub users: <b>4nd3r</b> and <b>257</b> and Mutt Developers:
  <b>David&nbsp;Sterba</b>, <b>Fabian&nbsp;Groffen</b> and
  <b>Karel&nbsp;Zak</b>.
</p>

<h2>Original Patch Authors</h2>

<p>
  Without the original patch authors, there would be nothing.
  So, a <b>Big Thank You</b> to:
